     <p1>It not uncommon to encounter people who have a well defined life plan, with goals for different stages to be achieved. However, among these individuals, it’s possible to find some who attribute a deeper purpose to this planning. 

        These people have an inner compass that points towards the pursuit of greater tasks, which go beyond the more common practical planning, usually involving one’s profession, emotional life, and often including marriage and children, assets and travel. The life program is related to the individual’s involvement in altruistic actions that benefit others and often a large group of consciousnesses. 
        
        Conscientiology, the science of self-knowledge and self-verification, introduces an advanced concept of life planning, coining a new term that is more aligned to its development in meaning. Thus, we have the resulting contracted term EXIStential PROgram = Proexis. 
        
        The term Proexis is an advanced concept that involves multiexistential and multidimensional elements, that is, it takes into consideration our actions across many lives and dimensions. It’s also innovative in its meaning because the existential program is developed before a person’s rebirth, or resoma (when they are reborn into a new soma or physical body). 
        
        The Proexis is a deep planning process that considers the characteristics already consolidated by the consciousness, with the participation of more evolved consciousnesses, as well as the consciousness that will undergo resoma or rebirth. Therefore, the proexis is something inherent, pulsating within the person, like a constant reminder of what had been planned and arranged extraphysically

      <p2><p><strong>2.Robotic</strong></p> However, in the 1940s, the Oxford English Dictionary credited science fiction author Isaac Asimov for being the first person to use the term. In Asimov's story, he suggested three principles to guide the behavior of autonomous robots and smart machines:

        Robots must never harm human beings.
        Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1.
        Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules.
        His three laws of robotics have survived to the present day. However, it wasn't until a couple of decades later, in 1961, that the first programmable robot -- called Unimate, derived from universal automation -- was created based on designs from the '50s to move scalding metal pieces from a die-cast machine. The Stanford Research Institute's robot dubbed Shakey followed suit in 1966 as the first mobile robot, thanks to software and hardware that enabled it to sense and grasp the environment, though in a limited capacity.
